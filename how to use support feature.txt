Command Setup Instructions
After adding this file to your project:

Start the bot and use /setup to enable the "Ticket System" feature
Use /ticket in the channel where you want the ticket panel to appear
Use /transcripts in the channel where you want ticket transcripts and feedback to be sent
How It Works
Initialization: The system loads previous configuration on startup
Panel Creation: Admins use /ticket to create a ticket panel with all options
User Flow:
Users select a ticket category from the dropdown
For general/bot questions, a modal collects their question
Tickets create a private channel with proper permissions
Support Process:
Support staff and the user communicate in the ticket channel
Anyone can close the ticket with the close button
Closure & Feedback:
When closed, a transcript is created and saved
The user receives a DM asking for feedback (rating + comments)
Feedback is posted to the transcript channel
